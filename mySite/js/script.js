    description: 'This was the first class project I had ever attempted. I threw together a few colors I liked for the visuals, but I really had fun playing with how the RNG decided your fate. I decided on a randomizer with case statements. If I were to revisit this project, I'd add more options and an animation for the clouds. I also think that the ability to save your responses in order to "see different futures" wouldn't be an unwelcome addition.',

    description: 'This project tasked us with simulating credit card verification to follow certain conditions. I recall having trouble checking for and disallowing NaN characters. Having discovered the logic to make it work was a really fulfilling moment for me. It's why I love JS. I think this project was the one that really highlighted for me the importance of function organization. P.S. Peep the pun.',

I definitely need to go back in there and DRY that code up, though.',

    description: 'In this project, we had to edit a website by replacing the content and repairing functionality. I had a LOT of ideas for this site, but only the features you see made the deadline. I was able to edit a lot of content, and implement some interesting script tricks without interfering too much with the CSS. I learned about how to consider one's own strengths and motivations when working against time. Also, Fire Emblem is a great game with a rich history, and this site barely scratches the surface; please go play it.',
